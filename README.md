## Custom-Neural-Network-for-Heart-Attack-Prediction-Unique-Features-Selection-and-Weights
Design the customize neural network model for Health care: Heart attack possibility by
following theconditions
I. Perform extensive feature extraction approach
II. Design the unique feature selection algorithm
III. Use five hidden layers and sigmoid activation function
IV. Weights of model must be in customized form ( Notuse the predefined weights)
